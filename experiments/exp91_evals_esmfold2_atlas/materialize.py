"""Materialize selected Atlas reps into contacts-v1-ready parquet shards (stage 3).

All data here comes from the **ESM Atlas** (``folds_1B.lance``); "afdb-24M" never
enters as a data source. ``pipeline.py`` produces ``selected_manifest.csv`` — one
row per chosen cluster representative (``protein_hash`` + metadata), but **no
structures**. This is the final step: it pulls those rows' ``structure_blob`` from
the Atlas, decodes each to mmCIF text, and writes parquet in the column layout
``contacts-v1 generate`` reads (``entry_id`` + ``cif_content``; the generator's
defaults, see ``marinfold/document_structures/contacts_v1/parse.py``).

Two stages, both resumable and heavily logged (the lessons from the funnel runs):

1. ``plan`` — locate each manifest rep's *absolute Atlas row index* with one cheap
   pass over the small ``protein_hash`` column (never the multi-TB ``structure_blob``),
   then sort by row index and split into ``plan/chunk_NNNNN.parquet`` files of
   ``--chunk-size`` reps each (rep metadata joined in). ~66.76M reps -> ~3.3k chunks.

2. ``run`` — decode. Worker processes pull chunks; each does a Lance ``take`` of only
   its reps' ``structure_blob`` (so we read ~1.65 TB, not the whole ~27 TB blob
   column), decodes to mmCIF, and writes one ``parts/part_NNNNN.parquet``. **A part
   file IS the checkpoint**: a relaunch skips any chunk whose part already exists
   (locally or in the ``--skip-list`` the launcher builds from S3), so a crash costs
   at most the in-flight chunks.

``full`` runs ``plan`` (unless a plan is already present) then ``run``.

Smoke test: ``--limit N`` caps the plan to the first N reps it locates and stops the
scan early, so ``full --limit 500`` finishes in seconds end to end.

Output parquet columns (per rep). Names align with timodonnell/afdb-24M where we have
the field (entry_id, cif_content, seq_len, global_plddt, seq_cluster_id, split) so the
two datasets union cleanly; the rest are Atlas-specific extras:
  entry_id        protein_hash (afdb-24M id column)
  cif_content     decoded mmCIF text (per-residue pLDDT in the B-factor column)
  seq_len         residue count (afdb-24M)
  global_plddt    mean pLDDT 0-1 (afdb-24M name; renamed from the Atlas mean_plddt)
  seq_cluster_id  our linclust @40%-id cluster (afdb-24M name; renamed from cluster_id)
  split           constant "train" (afdb-24M name)
  sequence        residue sequence (from the decoded structure) [extra]
  seq_ok          bool: decoded sequence == Atlas ``sequence`` column (integrity) [extra]
  ptm, plddt_std, cluster_size   from the manifest [extra]
  source          constant "esm-atlas-v1" provenance tag [extra]

Publishing the result to HuggingFace is a **separate, sign-off-gated** step
(cross-cloud, >10 GB, CC BY-SA) — this script never does it.
